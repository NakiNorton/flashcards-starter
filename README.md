# Flash Cards

## Abstract
Flash Cards is a command-line based application. The user can see the questions, take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round. This project was built with Javascript, using Test Driven Development to drive the implementation of the code.

## Application in action:  
Use the up/down arrow keys to select an answer, or use the number key for the answer you would like to select (1, 2 or 3):

At the end of the round you will get a message displaying the percentage of questions you got correct:

Invalid inputs will produce an error message on the terminal:
